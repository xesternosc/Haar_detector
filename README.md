# Haar_detector

Current project implements a vision-based frontal-face detection algorithm for autonomous
systems like PCs, robots or vehicles. For that purpose Haar-like features are used to discriminate frontal-faces in static images or video frames. Major task of the project is the implementation of a real-time object detection framework proposed by Viola and Jones (2001) in Vivado HLS. HLS accelerator is going to be integrated
in the Speedway “Smarter Vision on Zynq” workshop’s design project.
